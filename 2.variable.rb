# Variables in ruby don't need to assign data type

# 1. Global variable - start with $
$global_variable = "50"
puts ("global variable = " + $global_variable)

# 2. local variable - don't need start sign
local_variable = "20"
puts "local_variable = " + local_variable
puts ("local_variable = " + local_variable)
